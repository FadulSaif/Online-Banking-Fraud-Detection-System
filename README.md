# Online-Banking-Fraud-Detection-System
This is a fraud detection system that identifies suspicious online banking activities such as abnormal login behavior and unusual money transfers. The project uses a SQL Server database, follows the full CRISP-DM lifecycle, applies moderate machine learning models, and presents results through both a Python notebook and a simple dashboard.
